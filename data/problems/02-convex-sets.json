Therefore C̄ ⊇ ⋂K.\n\n**Left-to-right (C̄ ⊆ ⋂K)**: Note that C̄ itself is closed and contains C. If C̄ were convex (which we're proving), then C̄ ∈ ℱ, so C̄ ⊇ ⋂K.\n\nBut actually, we can argue directly: C̄ is the **smallest closed set** containing C. The intersection ⋂_{K∈ℱ} K is closed (arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed), contains C, hence contains C̄. Conversely, C̄ is one such closed set if we ignore convexity momentarily.\n\n### Convexity from intersection\n\nSince each K ∈ ℱ is convex, and intersections of convex sets are convex:\n\n⋂_{K∈ℱ} K is convex\n\nTherefore C̄ is convex. ∎\n\n## Alternative Characterization\n\nThe closure C̄ can also be characterized as:\n\nC̄ = {x ∈ ℝⁿ | ∀ε > 0, B_ε(x) ∩ C ≠ ∅}\n\nwhere B_ε(x) = {y : |y - x| < ε} is the open ball.\n\nFor x₁, x₂ ∈ C̄ and θ ∈ [0,1], for any ε > 0, choose y₁ ∈ B_{ε/2}(x₁) ∩ C and y₂ ∈ B_{ε/2}(x₂) ∩ C.

Since ε was arbitrary, θx₁ + (1-θ)x₂ ∈ C̄. ∎\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **Closure preserves convexity**: Taking limits of convex combinations stays convex\n2. **Continuity of convex operations**: The map (x, y, θ) ↦ θx + (1-θ)y is continuous\n3. **Closed convex hull**: C̄ when C is convex is called the **closed convex hull** of C\n4. **Intersection characterization**: Closed convex sets can be characterized as intersections of closed halfspaces (supporting hyperplane theorem)\n5. **Finite dimensions vs. infinite**: This proof works in ℝⁿ; in infinite dimensions, closure may not preserve convexity without additional assumptions\n6. **Stability property**: Convexity is \"robust\" under closure—small perturbations don't destroy it",

We will prove θx + (1-θ)y ∈ C for every θ ∈ [0,1].\n\n### Step 1 (Dyadic coefficients)\n\n**Claim**: For any dyadic rational θ = m/2ʳ with integers m, r ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2ʳ,\n\nθx + (1-θ)y ∈ C\n\n**Proof by induction on r**:\n\n**Base case r = 0**: θ ∈ {0, 1}\n- If θ = 0: θx + (1-θ)y = y ∈ C ✓\n- If θ = 1: θx + (1-θ)y = x ∈ C ✓\n\n**Inductive step**: Assume the claim holds for r-1. Consider θ = m/2ʳ.\n\n**Case 1**: m is even, say m = 2k. Then θ = k/2^(r-1), which has the form from r-1. By induction, θx + (1-θ)y ∈ C. ✓\n\n**Case 2**: m is odd, say m = 2k+1. Then:\n\nθ = (2k+1)/2ʳ = k/2^(r-1) · (1/2) + (k+1)/2^(r-1) · (1/2)\n\nLet:\n- θ₁ = k/2^(r-1)\n- θ₂ = (k+1)/2^(r-1)\n\nNote that θ = (θ₁ + θ₂)/2.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis:\n\nu₁ := θ₁x + (1-θ₁)y ∈ C\nu₂ := θ₂x + (1-θ₂)y ∈ C\n\nBy midpoint-convexity:\n\n(u₁ + u₂)/2 ∈ C\n\nBut:\n\n(u₁ + u₂)/2 = (θ₁x + (1-θ₁)y + θ₂x + (1-θ₂)y)/2\n             = ((θ₁+θ₂)/2)x + ((2-(θ₁+θ₂))/2)y\n             = θx + (1-θ)y ∈ C ✓\n\nBy induction, dyadic rationals work.\n\n### Step 2 (Density of dyadic rationals)\n\nDyadic rationals in [0,1] are **dense**: for any θ ∈ [0,1] and any ε > 0, there exists a dyadic rational θ' with |θ - θ'| < ε.\n\nEquivalently, there exists a sequence of dyadic rationals (θₖ) with θₖ → θ.\n\n### Step 3 (Construct sequence in C)\n\nChoose a sequence of dyadic rationals θₖ → θ. By Step 1, for each k:\n\nwₖ := θₖx + (1-θₖ)y ∈ C\n\n### Step 4 (Pass to the limit)\n\nThe map θ ↦ θx + (1-θ)y is continuous (it's affine in θ). Therefore:\n\nwₖ = θₖx + (1-θₖ)y → θx + (1-θ)y\n\nas k → ∞.\n\n### Step 5 (Use closedness)\n\nSince each wₖ ∈ C and C is closed:\n\nlim_{k→∞} wₖ ∈ C̄ = C\n\nTherefore:\n\nθx + (1-θ)y ∈ C\n\nSince x, y, and θ were arbitrary, C is convex. ∎\n\n## Why \"Closed\" is Essential\n\n**Counterexample without closedness**:\n\nLet C = ℚ ∩ [0,1] (rationals in [0,1]).\n\n**Midpoint-convex**: If x, y ∈ ℚ, then (x+y)/2 ∈ ℚ. ✓\n\n**Not convex**: Take x = 0, y = 1, θ = √2/2 ≈ 0.707...\n\nThen θx + (1-θ)y = (2-√2)/2 ∉ ℚ, so θx + (1-θ)y ∉ C.\n\nHence C is midpoint-convex but **not convex**.\n\n**Why it fails**: C is not closed (C̄ = [0,1] ⊃ C). The limit argument in Step 5 breaks down because the limit might not be in C.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **Midpoint-convexity is weaker**: Midpoint-convexity (only θ = 1/2) is strictly weaker than convexity (all θ ∈ [0,1])\n2. **Closure bridges the gap**: Adding closedness makes midpoint-convexity equivalent to convexity\n3. **Dyadic density**: The dyadic rationals {m/2ʳ} are dense in [0,1], which is key to the approximation\n4. **Inductive construction**: The proof builds up from 1/2 to all dyadic rationals by repeated subdivision\n5. **Limit arguments**: Passing to limits requires closedness—this is a common pattern in analysis\n6. **Topological + algebraic**: The result combines topology (closedness, limits) with algebra (dyadic arithmetic)\n7. **Applications**: This is used in functional analysis where midpoint-convexity is sometimes easier to verify directly",

The dyadic construction is clever—it builds all binary fractions by repeated bisection, then uses density to reach all real coefficients. The counterexample (rationals in [0,1]) is instructive: it shows closedness is truly necessary. This theorem appears in functional analysis when studying convex functions on Banach spaces, where sometimes only midpoint-convexity can be verified directly. The proof technique—building dyadic rationals inductively—appears in many contexts (e.g., proving uniqueness of Lebesgue measure)."

Since each C ∈ ℱ is convex, K is convex. ✓\n\n**S ⊆ K**: Every C ∈ ℱ contains S, so their intersection K contains S. ✓\n\n### Direction 1: conv(S) ⊆ K\n\n**Goal**: Show every point in conv(S) lies in K.\n\nTake any C ∈ ℱ.

The proof is straightforward but instructive: one direction uses that convex sets must be closed under convex combinations, the other uses that conv(S) is itself convex. This result is foundational in convex geometry and connects to duality theory—the implicit description via intersections of halfspaces leads to the dual representation via support functions. In computational geometry, this characterization justifies algorithms that compute convex hulls by finding supporting hyperplanes."
