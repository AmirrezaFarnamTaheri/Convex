1. Basic Setup and One-Dimensional Geometry

Image 1: Conjugate Function as Maximum Gap

Description: A 2D plot showing a convex function curve $f(x) = x^2/2 + 1$ (blue curve).

A linear function $h(x) = yx$ (for a fixed slope $y=1.5$) is drawn as a straight red line passing through the origin.

The vertical gap $yx - f(x)$ is highlighted at several $x$ points.

The maximum gap occurs at a specific point $x^*$. A vertical arrow labeled "Supremum Value = $f^*(y)$" connects the line $yx$ down to the curve $f(x)$ at this optimal $x^*$.

This visualizes the definition $f^*(y) = \sup_x (yx - f(x))$.

Image 2: Supporting Line Interpretation

Description: A geometric construction for a 1D convex function.

A convex curve $f(x)$ is plotted.

A tangent line with slope $y$ touches the curve at point $x^*$.

The equation of this tangent line is $L(x) = yx - f^*(y)$.

The line intersects the vertical y-axis at the value $-f^*(y)$.

This visually demonstrates that $f^*(y)$ determines the vertical intercept (negative) of the supporting hyperplane with slope $y$.

2. Convexity of the Conjugate

Image 3: Conjugate as Supremum of Affine Functions

Description: A plot in the dual variable space $y$.

Several affine lines $g_x(y) = x \cdot y - f(x)$ are drawn for different fixed values of $x$ (e.g., $x_1, x_2, x_3$). Each line has slope $x$ and intercept $-f(x)$.

The function $f^*(y)$ is the upper envelope (pointwise supremum) of all these lines.

The resulting upper envelope forms a convex "V" shape or curve, visually proving that the conjugate $f^*$ is always convex, regardless of the shape of $f$.

Image 4: Epigraph Intersection

Description: A 3D visualization of the epigraph of $f^*$.

The space represents $(y, \alpha)$.

Multiple half-spaces $H_x = \{(y, \alpha) \mid y^T x - f(x) \le \alpha\}$ are shown as flat planes with "below" regions shaded.

The intersection of all these half-spaces forms a convex polyhedral-like solid, which is the epigraph of $f^*$.

This corresponds to the "intersection of halfspaces" proof of convexity.

3. Fenchel-Young Inequality

Image 5: Fenchel-Young Geometry

Description: A diagram illustrating the inequality $f(x) + f^*(y) \ge xy$.

A convex function $f(x)$ and a line with slope $y$ passing through the origin are shown.

The value $xy$ is the area of a rectangle with sides $x$ and $y$ (abstractly).

More intuitively: The tangent line with slope $y$ has equation $L(z) = yz - f^*(y)$.

At any point $x$, the function value $f(x)$ is visibly above the tangent line value: $f(x) \ge yx - f^*(y)$, which rearranges to the Fenchel-Young inequality.

The "equality case" is highlighted where the tangent touches the curve.

4. Classical Examples

Image 6: Conjugate of Absolute Value (Dual Norm Indicator)

Description: A side-by-side plot.

Left (Primal): The absolute value function $f(x) = |x|$. It's a V-shape.

Right (Dual): The conjugate function $f^*(y)$. It is the indicator function of the interval $[-1, 1]$.

For $y \in (-1, 1)$, the value is $0$ (flat line on the axis).

At $y = -1$ and $y = 1$, vertical walls shoot up to infinity.

Outside $[-1, 1]$, the function is undefined or $+\infty$.

This visualizes the conjugate of a norm being the indicator of the dual unit ball.

Image 7: Conjugate of Indicator Function (Support Function)

Description: A geometric illustration in 2D space.

A convex set $C$ (e.g., a pentagon) is shown.

A direction vector $y$ is drawn from the origin.

A supporting hyperplane (line) perpendicular to $y$ touches the boundary of $C$ at the furthest point in direction $y$.

The distance from the origin to this supporting line (projected onto $y$) is labeled $\sigma_C(y) = \delta_C^*(y)$.

This visualizes the conjugate of the indicator function as the support function.

5. Biconjugate and Convexification

Image 8: Biconjugate as Convex Hull

Description: A comparison of a non-convex function and its biconjugate.

Function: A smooth "W" shaped curve $f(x)$ (non-convex, with two local minima).

Biconjugate: A dashed line connects the two bottom tips of the "W", bridging the gap. This new function $f^{**}(x)$ follows the original curve on the outer wings but is flat in the middle.

This visually represents the "closed convex envelope" or the tightest convex lower bound of the original non-convex function.
