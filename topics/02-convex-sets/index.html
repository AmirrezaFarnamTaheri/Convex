        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This lecture introduces the geometric soul of convex optimization: the convex set. We define what makes a set "convex," explore canonical examples like polyhedra and cones, and develop a powerful algebra of operations that preserve convexity. The lecture culminates in the Separating and Supporting Hyperplane Theorems, fundamental results that provide the geometric intuition for duality theory and optimality conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Solid understanding of linear algebra (<a href="../00-linear-algebra-primer/index.html">Lecture 00</a>) and the basic definition of a convex problem (<a href="../01-introduction/index.html">Lecture 01</a>).</p>
        <p><strong>Connections:</strong> The feasible sets of LPs and QPs from Lecture 01 are proven convex here. The hyperplane theorems are the essential geometric foundation for duality (Lecture 05) and KKT optimality conditions (Lecture 06).</p>

        <h2>1. Affine and Convex Sets</h2>
        <p>The geometry of optimization is built on two key ways of combining points: affine and convex combinations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An <b>affine combination</b> is a weighted sum $\sum \theta_i x_i$ where weights sum to one, $\sum \theta_i = 1$. This describes lines and planes.</li>
            <li>A <b>convex combination</b> is an affine combination where weights are also non-negative, $\theta_i \ge 0$. This describes "filled-in" shapes like line segments.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Convex Sets</h3>
        <p>A set is <b>convex</b> if the line segment connecting any two points in the set is entirely contained within the set. This property means the set has no "dents" or "holes."</p>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Figure 1.1: In a convex set, the line segment connecting any two points lies entirely within the set.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Convex Hulls</h3>
        <p>The <b>convex hull</b> of a set of points, $\mathrm{conv}(S)$, is the set of all their convex combinations. It's the smallest convex set containing all the points, like the shape formed by a rubber band stretched around them.</p>

        <h2>2. Canonical Convex Sets</h2>
        <p>These are the fundamental building blocks of most optimization models.</p>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Hyperplanes and Halfspaces</h3>
          <p>A <b>hyperplane</b> $\{x \mid a^\top x = b\}$ is affine and thus convex. A <b>halfspace</b> $\{x \mid a^\top x \le b\}$ is convex. They are the simplest building blocks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Ellipsoids and Norm Balls</h3>
          <p>An <b>ellipsoid</b> $\mathcal{E} = \{x \mid (x-x_c)^\top P^{-1} (x-x_c) \le 1\}$ (for $P \succ 0$) and a <b>norm ball</b> $\{x \mid \|x-x_c\| \le r\}$ are both convex.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Polyhedra</h3>
          <p>A <b>polyhedron</b> is the solution set of a finite number of linear equalities and inequalities, $\mathcal{P} = \{x \mid Ax \preceq b, Cx=d\}$. As the intersection of halfspaces and hyperplanes, it is always convex.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Cones</h3>
          <p>A set $K$ is a <b>cone</b> if for every $x \in K$ and $\theta \ge 0$, $\theta x \in K$. A <b>convex cone</b> is a cone that is also a convex set. Important examples include the <b>second-order cone</b> and the <b>positive semidefinite (PSD) cone</b> $\mathbb{S}^n_+$.</p>

      <section class="card" id="section-3">
        <h2>3. Operations that Preserve Convexity</h2>
        <p>We can prove a complex set is convex by building it from simpler convex sets using operations that preserve convexity.</p>
        <h3>Intersection</h3>
        <p>The intersection of any collection of convex sets is convex. This is one of the most useful properties. For example, a polyhedron is convex because it is an intersection of convex halfspaces.</p>
        <h3>Affine Functions</h3>
        <p>Applying an affine function $f(x) = Ax+b$ preserves convexity.
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>image</b> of a convex set $C$, $f(C) = \{Ax+b \mid x \in C\}$, is convex.</li>
            <li>The <b>preimage</b> of a convex set $D$, $f^{-1}(D) = \{x \mid Ax+b \in D\}$, is convex.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
          <h4>Application: Proving an Ellipsoid is Convex</h4>
          <p>An ellipsoid $\mathcal{E} = \{x \mid \|P^{-1/2}(x-x_c)\|_2 \le 1\}$ is the preimage of the unit Euclidean ball (a convex set) under the affine map $f(x) = P^{-1/2}(x-x_c)$. Since the preimage of a convex set under an affine map is convex, the ellipsoid is convex.</p>

        <h2>4. Separating and Supporting Hyperplanes</h2>
        <p>These theorems are among the most important in optimization, providing the geometric basis for duality theory.</p>
        <h3>The Separating Hyperplane Theorem</h3>
        <p>Any two disjoint, non-empty convex sets can be separated by a hyperplane. If you have two convex shapes that do not overlap, you can always draw a straight line (or plane) between them.</p>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Figure 4.1: A hyperplane separating two disjoint convex sets.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>The Supporting Hyperplane Theorem</h3>
        <p>For any convex set, at any point on its boundary, there exists a supporting hyperplane that touches the point and keeps the entire set to one side. This is fundamental for deriving optimality conditions.</p>

      <section class="card" id="section-5">
        <h2>5. Dual Cones</h2>
        <p>The geometric starting point for duality theory is the dual cone. The <b>dual cone</b> of a cone $K$ is:
        $$ K^* = \{y \mid y^\top x \ge 0 \text{ for all } x \in K\} $$
        It is the set of all vectors that make a non-negative inner product with every vector in $K$. $K^*$ is always a closed, convex cone.
        </p>
        <h3>Self-Dual Cones</h3>
        <p>Some of the most important cones are <b>self-dual</b> ($K^* = K$).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>non-negative orthant</b> $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ is self-dual.</li>
            <li>The <b>second-order cone</b> is self-dual.</li>
            <li>The <b>positive semidefinite cone</b> $\mathbb{S}^n_+$ is self-dual.</li>

        <h2>6. Problem Set & Solutions</h2>
        <div class="problem">
          <h3>P2.1 — Convexity of a Set</h3>
          <p>Show that the set of points closer to a given point $x_0$ than to another point $y_0$, defined as $C = \{x \mid \|x-x_0\|_2 \le \|x-y_0\|_2\}$, is a convex set.</p>
          <div class="solution">
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>The defining inequality is $\|x-x_0\|_2 \le \|x-y_0\|_2$. Since both sides are non-negative, we can square them:
            $$ \|x-x_0\|_2^2 \le \|x-y_0\|_2^2 $$
            Expanding this gives $x^\top x - 2x_0^\top x + x_0^\top x_0 \le x^\top x - 2y_0^\top x + y_0^\top y_0$.
            <br>The $x^\top x$ terms cancel, and we can rearrange to get:
            $$ 2(y_0 - x_0)^\top x \le \|y_0\|_2^2 - \|x_0\|_2^2 $$
            This is a single linear inequality of the form $a^\top x \le b$. The set of points satisfying such an inequality is a halfspace, which is a convex set.

          <h3>P2.2 — Dual of a Subspace</h3>
          <p>Let $V$ be a linear subspace. What is its dual cone $V^*$? Provide a proof for your answer.</p>
          <div class="solution">
              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>The dual cone of a subspace $V$ is its orthogonal complement, $V^\perp$.
              <br><b>Proof:</b> The dual cone is $V^* = \{y \mid y^\top x \ge 0 \text{ for all } x \in V\}$.
              <br>First, let's show $V^\perp \subseteq V^*$. If $y \in V^\perp$, then $y^\top x = 0$ for all $x \in V$. The condition $0 \ge 0$ is satisfied, so $y \in V^*$.
              <br>Next, let's show $V^* \subseteq V^\perp$. Suppose $y \in V^*$, so $y^\top x \ge 0$ for all $x \in V$. Since $V$ is a subspace, if $x \in V$, then $-x \in V$ as well. So we must also have $y^\top (-x) \ge 0$, which implies $-y^\top x \ge 0$, or $y^\top x \le 0$.
              <br>The only way for $y^\top x \ge 0$ and $y^\top x \le 0$ to both be true is if $y^\top x = 0$. This must hold for all $x \in V$, which is the definition of $y$ being in the orthogonal complement $V^\perp$.
              <br>Thus, $V^* = V^\perp$.
