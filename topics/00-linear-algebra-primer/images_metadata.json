    "description": "A visualization of the Schur complement process as a transformation of matrix structure. Left: A large square matrix M partitioned into blocks A (top-left, red), B (top-right, blue), C (bottom-left, blue), and D (bottom-right, green). The determinant of the whole block matrix is represented as the volume of a parallelpiped formed by its column vectors. Center: An 'Elimination Matrix' E (block lower triangular) acting on M. Right: The result ME which is block upper triangular. The bottom-right block is still D, but the top-left block has transformed into the Schur complement S = A - BD^{-1}C. The determinant is now clearly det(S) * det(D), visualized as the product of the 'volumes' of the diagonal blocks."
