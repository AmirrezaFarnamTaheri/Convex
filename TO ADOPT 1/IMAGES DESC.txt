### 1. Schur Complement Geometry

**Image 1: The Block Matrix Transformation**
> **Description:** A visualization of the Schur complement process as a transformation of matrix structure.
> * **Left:** A large square matrix $M$ partitioned into blocks $A$ (top-left, red), $B$ (top-right, blue), $C$ (bottom-left, blue), and $D$ (bottom-right, green). The determinant of the whole block matrix is represented as the volume of a parallelpiped formed by its column vectors.
> * **Center:** An "Elimination Matrix" $E$ (block lower triangular) acting on $M$.
> * **Right:** The result $ME$ which is block upper triangular. The bottom-right block is still $D$, but the top-left block has transformed into the Schur complement $S = A - BD^{-1}C$. The determinant is now clearly $\det(S) \times \det(D)$, visualized as the product of the "volumes" of the diagonal blocks.



### 2. Scalar Composition Rules

**Image 2: Convex Composition (Case 1: Convex + Increasing)**
> **Description:** A step-by-step graphical composition.
> * **Panel 1 (Inner):** Graph of a convex function $g(x) = x^2$. Two points $x_1, x_2$ and their chord are shown, illustrating the convexity inequality $g(\text{avg}) \le \text{avg}(g)$.
> * **Panel 2 (Outer):** Graph of a convex, increasing function $h(u) = e^u$. The output range of $g$ maps to the input domain of $h$.
> * **Panel 3 (Composite):** Graph of $f(x) = e^{x^2}$. The convexity is preserved and amplified. The visual logic shows how the "smile" of $g$ is stretched upwards by $h$, making the resulting curve even more convex.

**Image 3: Concave Composition (Case 2: Concave + Decreasing)**
> **Description:** A similar 3-panel composition.
> * **Panel 1:** Graph of a concave function $g(x) = \sqrt{x}$. The chord lies below the curve.
> * **Panel 2:** Graph of a convex, decreasing function $h(u) = 1/u$.
> * **Panel 3:** Graph of $f(x) = 1/\sqrt{x}$. The "frown" of $g$ is flipped by the decreasing nature of $h$ into a "smile", and the convexity of $h$ reinforces it, resulting in a convex composite function.

### 4. Quasiconvexity and Quasiconcavity

**Image 6: Sublevel Sets of a Quasiconvex Function**
> **Description:** A 3D surface plot of a function that is quasiconvex but not convex (e.g., a "volcano" shape with a monotonic crater, or a bell curve inverted).
> * Horizontal planes cut through the surface at various heights $\alpha$.
> * The resulting cross-sections (sublevel sets $S_\alpha$) are projected onto the $xy$-plane.
> * All these projected sets are convex shapes (circles, ellipses), satisfying the definition.
> * A chord connecting two points on the surface is shown passing *above* the function surface in the middle (violating convexity), but the "no overshoot" condition holds relative to the max endpoint.

**Image 7: First-Order Condition (Gradient)**
> **Description:** A contour plot of a quasiconvex function.
> * A point $x$ is marked on a contour line $f(x) = c$.
> * The gradient vector $\nabla f(x)$ is drawn perpendicular to the contour, pointing towards higher values (outwards).
> * A region of "lower or equal values" ($f(y) \le f(x)$) is shaded.
> * Several vectors $y-x$ are drawn from $x$ into this shaded region.
> * The angle between $\nabla f(x)$ and any vector $y-x$ is shown to be $\ge 90^\circ$ (obtuse), visually confirming $\nabla f(x)^T(y-x) \le 0$.

### 5. Log-Concavity

**Image 8: The Gaussian Density vs. Parabola**
> **Description:** A visual comparison.
> * **Top:** A standard Gaussian bell curve $f(x)$. It has an inflection point and is bell-shaped (not concave).
> * **Bottom:** The graph of $\log f(x)$. This transforms the bell curve into a perfect, downward-opening parabola (concave quadratic).
> * This visually proves that the Gaussian is log-concave.

**Image 9: Log-Concavity Preservation under Intersection**
> **Description:** An abstract diagram representing Prékopa’s Theorem.
> * A 3D log-concave function $f(x,y)$ (like a multivariate Gaussian hill).
> * A 2D plane represents the marginalization (integration over $y$).
> * The resulting "shadow" or marginal distribution $g(x)$ is drawn on the axis.
> * The curve of $\log g(x)$ is shown to be concave, illustrating the preservation property.
