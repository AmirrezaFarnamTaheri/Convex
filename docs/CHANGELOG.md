## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Lecture 03 (Convex Functions):**
    - **Conjugate Functions (Section 7):** Expanded section with detailed derivations for 1D examples (affine, log, exponential, reciprocal), matrix examples (quadratic, log-det), support functions, and economic interpretations (profit vs. revenue).
    - **Quasiconvexity (Section 8):** Added second-order conditions and new examples (IRR, distance ratio).
    - **Log-concavity (Section 4.4):** Added integration rules and probability examples (Gaussian CDF, hitting convex sets).
    - **Exercise P3.15:** Added exercise on Fenchel's Inequality and Biconjugates.

### Updated
- **Lecture 02 (Convex Sets):** Added forward link connecting Support Functions to Conjugate Functions.
- **Lecture 05 (Duality):** Added insight block connecting Shadow Prices to conjugate function profit interpretations.
