# Widget Audit Findings

This document summarizes the findings of the widget audit performed on [Date].

## Summary of Findings

The majority of the implemented widgets are in good condition. The audit identified the following issues:

*   **Inconsistent Naming:** Several widget filenames did not match the names in the documentation. This has been corrected in `docs/WIDGETS_PER_LECTURE.md`.
*   **Duplicate Widgets:** Several duplicate widgets were found. These have been removed, and the documentation has been updated.
*   **Undocumented Widgets:** Several implemented widgets were not listed in the documentation. These have been added to `docs/WIDGETS_PER_LECTURE.md`.
*   **Misleading Comment:** The `rank-nullspace.js` widget contains a misleading comment about using `scipy`.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Remove Misleading Comment:** Remove the comment about `scipy` from `rank-nullspace.js`.
*   **Code Review:** Perform a code review of all implemented widgets to identify any other potential issues.
*   **Testing:** Create a testing plan to ensure that all widgets are functioning correctly.
