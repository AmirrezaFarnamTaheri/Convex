# Widget Development Priority

**High Priority (start here):**
1. Convex vs Nonconvex Explorer (Lecture 01) — Teaches the core intuition
2. Gradient Descent Visualizer (Lecture 09) — Algorithm understanding is central
3. Jensen's Inequality Visualizer (Lecture 03) — Foundational for convexity
4. Classification Boundary Visualizer (Lecture 07) — Real-world relevance, exciting for students
5. Barrier Method Path Tracer (Lecture 11) — Elegant illustration of modern solvers

**Medium Priority (next batch):**
6. Ellipsoid Explorer (Lecture 02) — Beautiful geometry
7. Duality Visualizer (Lecture 05) — Profound concept, worth illustrating
8. LP Visualizer: Simplex (Lecture 04) — Classic algorithm
9. Hessian Eigenvalue Visualizer (Lecture 03) — Connects LA to convexity
10. Convex Set Checker (Lecture 02) — Interactive definition testing

**Lower Priority (polish later):**
11. Least Squares & Regularization Playground (Lecture 06) — Educational but less dramatic
12. Robust Regression Visualizer (Lecture 06) — More niche
13. Sparse Recovery Demo (Lecture 06) — Needs solid Python backend
14. MVEE Visualizer (Lecture 08) — Complex SDP, nice but optional
15. Problem Form Recognizer (Lecture 04) — Educational, lower engagement
16. (Other widgets from Lectures 08, 10, etc.)

# Implementation Strategy

- **Week 1–2:** Build high-priority widgets; they unblock conceptual understanding
- **Week 3–5:** Expand to medium-priority; cover all lectures
- **Week 6+:** Polish, optimize performance, gather student feedback
- **Parallel:** Create diagrams and SVGs as soon as lecture outlines are finalized
