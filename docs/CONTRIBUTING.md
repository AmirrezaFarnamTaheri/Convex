## Key Success Factors

1. **Start Simple:** First widgets should be 2D, fast to load, visually immediate
2. **Iterate Weekly:** Push new lecture each week; gather feedback immediately
3. **Link Everything:** Every new concept references prior concepts and prerequisites
4. **Use Color & Animation:** Humans learn by seeing things move and change
5. **Make It Playable:** Students should want to click, drag, explore—not just read
6. **Balance Theory & Practice:** Theory (definitions) + intuition (visuals) + practice (widgets)
7. **Performance Matters:** Widgets that load slowly or lag will frustrate users; prioritize performance
8. **Accessibility:** Ensure colors aren't the only information carrier; use text labels, captions
9. **Document as You Go:** Every widget and asset needs a README explaining its purpose
10. **Feedback Loop:** Share drafts early; iterate based on student confusion points

## Final Notes

This roadmap is **comprehensive but flexible**. You don't need to build all widgets at once. Start with the high-priority ones, ship those, gather feedback, then expand. The beauty of a static site is that you can add, modify, and publish incrementally without downtime.

**Your teaching goal:** By the end of the course, students don't just understand convex optimization theory—they've *felt* it through interactive exploration. Algorithms converge visually on their screen. Duality clicks because they've seen it animated. That's the power of this scaffold.

**Your engineering goal:** A maintainable codebase that future instructors can fork, extend, and customize. Clean file organization, clear widget templates, and good documentation make this possible.

**Questions to ask yourself as you build:**
- Would I want to interact with this widget as a student?
- Can I explain what each file does in one sentence?
- Would a colleague be able to add a new lecture without asking me how?
