- **Relevance:** This image provides an excellent 3D visualization of a saddle point, which is a core concept in Lagrangian duality. It clearly shows the min-max structure, where the point is a minimum along one axis (primal variables) and a maximum along another (dual variables), helping to build intuition for the dual problem.
