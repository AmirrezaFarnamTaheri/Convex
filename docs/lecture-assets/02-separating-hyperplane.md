- **Description:** This image illustrates the separating hyperplane theorem. It shows two disjoint convex sets in a 2D plane, with a line (a hyperplane in 2D) separating them. This demonstrates that for any two disjoint convex sets, there exists a hyperplane such that the sets lie on opposite sides of it.
