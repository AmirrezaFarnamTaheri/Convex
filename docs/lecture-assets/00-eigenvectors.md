- **Description:** This animation visualizes the concept of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The red arrows represent the eigenvectors of a linear transformation. When the transformation is applied, the eigenvectors are simply scaled, and the scaling factor is the eigenvalue. The blue vector represents a non-eigenvector, which changes direction when the transformation is applied.
