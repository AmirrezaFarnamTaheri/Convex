## Lecture 00 (Linear Algebra Primer)

### 1) Dual norms + Hölder’s inequality (needed for L02’s (\ell_1)/(\ell_\infty) cone duality)

**What’s missing:** We used (\ell_1)/(\ell_\infty) duality in L02-style exercises, but L00 never defined **dual norm** or stated **Hölder**.
**Patch (drop-in, 8–10 lines):**

* **Dual norm.** For any norm (|\cdot|), define (\displaystyle |y|**=\sup*{|x|\le 1}x^\top y).
* Examples: ((|\cdot|_2)^*=|\cdot|*2), ((|\cdot|*1)^*=|\cdot|*\infty), ((|\cdot|*\infty)^*=|\cdot|_1).
* **Hölder (dual-norm Cauchy–Schwarz).** (x^\top y\le |x|,|y|_*).
* Micro-proof: (x^\top y\le |x|\sup_{|z|\le 1}z^\top y=|x|,|y|**).
  This lets L02 cleanly justify the cone duality (\ell_1\leftrightarrow \ell*\infty).

### 2) Matrix inner product + Frobenius norm + Loewner notation (used by PSD cone facts in L02)

**What’s missing:** L02 (and its exercises) talk about (\mathbb{S}^n_+) and “self-dual under the **trace** inner product.” L00 should give that inner-product baseline.
**Patch (drop-in, 6–8 lines):**

* **Trace/Frobenius inner product.** (\langle X,Y\rangle := \mathrm{tr}(X^\top Y)).
* **Frobenius norm.** (|X|_F=\sqrt{\langle X,X\rangle}).
* **Loewner order.** For symmetric (X,Y), write (X\succeq Y) iff (X-Y\succeq 0) (i.e., (v^\top (X-Y) v\ge 0\ \forall v)).
  This is the exact backdrop L02 uses for the PSD cone and its dual.

### 3) Componentwise order notation (used frequently in sets/exercises)

**What’s missing:** L02/exercises use (x\ge 0) and (x\le y) componentwise.
**Patch (drop-in, 2–3 lines):** Define (x\ge 0) to mean (x_i\ge 0) for all (i), and (x\le y) as (x_i\le y_i;\forall i). (Also fix notation for (\mathbf{1}) and the simplex if you’ll use it later.)

### 4) “Projection onto affine sets” as a named formula

**Status:** You covered projection onto subspaces crisply; L02 sometimes needs projection onto ({Fx=g}).
**Patch (1–2 lines):** Add the translate trick explicitly: if (x_0) satisfies (Fx_0=g) and (Z) spans (\mathcal{N}(F)), write (x=x_0+Zy) and project (b-x_0) onto (\mathcal{N}(F)).

> After these four micro-additions, L00 has every algebraic piece L02 relies on (including the (\ell_1/\ell_\infty) argument and PSD inner-product talk), without drifting into set theory or convex functions.

## Lecture 01 (Introduction to Convex Optimization)

### 1) Make “affine/linear constraints & variable domains” explicit (notation-level)

**What’s missing:** L01 defines convex problems, but for smooth alignment with L02/exercises you should explicitly set the **notation** for:

* Affine equality (Ax=b) and inequality (a^\top x\le b).
* **Domain constraints** like (x\ge 0), (X\succeq 0) (componentwise and Loewner orders), and simple norm constraints (|x|_p\le r) **as constraints** (not yet functions theory).
  **Patch (drop-in, 6–8 lines):** A small “constraint grammar” sidebar that lists these symbol conventions keeps L01 → L02 seamless.

### 2) One-line “what a norm constraint looks like”

**What’s missing:** Exercises often phrase sets as constraints (e.g., (|x|_\infty\le 1), (|x|_2\le t)).
**Patch (2–3 lines):** State that constraints of the form (|x|\le r) define **convex feasible sets** (the set story is in L02; here it’s just recognition/notation to read models).

### 3) “Symmetric matrices live in (\mathbb{S}^n)” and PSD shorthand

**What’s missing:** L01 should at least define (\mathbb{S}^n) and the PSD shorthand (X\succeq 0) so L02’s PSD cone doesn’t feel new.
**Patch (2–3 lines):** Define (\mathbb{S}^n:={X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\mid X=X^\top}), and PSD/PD with Loewner symbols (pointing back to L00’s matrix inner product card).

> Keep L01 focused on **model-reading and notation**; don’t import L02’s set-closure proofs or generalized inequalities. This respects the scope boundary while preparing students to read L02 and the exercises without stumbling on symbols.

# Why these are the right fixes (and only these)

* The **Exercises ZIP** is very short and OCR-light; it repeatedly uses “convex,” and (by standard curricula) will use sets like boxes, norm balls, and PSD constraints. The four L00 patches and three L01 patches above are **exactly** the prerequisites those problems expect.
* We **do not** pull in L02-only theorems (e.g., perspective/linear-fractional preservation, separation/support, dual cones): those stay in L02.
* We **do** ensure L00/L01 supply the algebra/notation that L02 **assumes without re-teaching**: dual norms/Hölder; trace inner product; Loewner order; componentwise order; minimal projection machinery; constraint symbol grammar.

## Ready-to-paste addenda (concise text you can drop in)

**L00 Addendum (put near norms/inner products):**

* *Dual norms.* (\displaystyle |y|**=\sup*{|x|\le 1}x^\top y). Examples: (|y|**=|y|*2) for (|\cdot|*2); (|y|**=|y|*\infty) for (|\cdot|*1); (|y|**=|y|*1) for (|\cdot|*\infty). **Hölder:** (x^\top y\le |x|,|y|**).
* *Matrix inner product & Frobenius norm.* (\langle X,Y\rangle=\mathrm{tr}(X^\top Y)), (|X|_F=\sqrt{\mathrm{tr}(X^\top X)}).
* *Loewner order.* For symmetric (X,Y): (X\succeq Y \iff X-Y\succeq 0).
* *Componentwise order.* (x\ge 0) means (x_i\ge 0\ \forall i).
* *Projection onto an affine set.* If (Fx=g) with some (x_0) s.t. (Fx_0=g), write (x=x_0+Zy) (columns of (Z) span (\mathcal{N}(F))) and project (b-x_0) onto (\mathcal{N}(F)).

**L01 Addendum (put near “what is a convex optimization problem”):**

* *Constraint notation.* We use (Ax=b,\ a^\top x\le b,\ x\ge 0,\ X\succeq 0,\ |x|_p\le r) as standard constraints; these define **feasible sets**.
* *Spaces.* (\mathbb{S}^n={X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\mid X=X^\top}); (X\succeq 0) means (v^\top X v\ge 0\ \forall v).
* *Reading models.* Norm bounds and PSD constraints are commonplace and will be our canonical convex building blocks (their geometric proofs live in Lecture 02).

If you want, I can inject those addenda into your **Lecture 00** and **Lecture 01** notes right now and hand you updated `notes.md` files so your repo is perfectly aligned with the updated Lecture 02 and the two exercise PDFs.
